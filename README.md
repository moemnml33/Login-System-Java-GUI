# Simple Login System With Java's GUI

To make it simple and for the purpose of learning to code with Java's built-in Graphical User Interface, the login credentials are hard coded. The "admin" user with password "admin" is automatically created with the default constructor of the IDandPasswords class.

## To add new users  

Simply go to the main driver and type "idandPasswords.addLoginInfo("user", "user");"

## How the program looks like:
